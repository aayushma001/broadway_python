# Loops are used to run the certain block of codes
# These are used to reduce manual effort and perform the task in automated way
# There are two types of loops in python; for loop and while loop


# for loop in different datatypes
vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]

for each in vowels:
    print(vowels)


# Looping is similar in tuples, List and set

# Now lets see looping in Dictionary Type
student = {"name": "jon", "age": 25, "address":"KTM"}
print(student.keys())

for key in student.keys():
    print(key)

print(student.values())
for value in student.values():
    print(value)

print(student.items())
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key) # tuple unpacking
    print(value)
# range() function
# We can give three parameters in the range function range(start, end, step_size)
a = range(10)  # gives from 0 to 9; 10 is exclusive
print(range)  # range object
print(list(a))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

a = range(2, 10)  # gives from 2 to 9
print(list(a))  # [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


a = (2, 10 , 2)  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(list(a))

squared = []
for i in range(1, 13):
    squared.append(i**2)
print(squared) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144]

squared = [i**2 for i in range(1, 13)]  # List comprehension
