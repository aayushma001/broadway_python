# Indentation in python is very important
# An indentation/tab is equivalent to 4 tabs
# we do not use curly braces in python to determine
# a block of code.Instead,we use indentation

# floowing is an example of a c code
# if(a==2){
# printf("hello world")
# }
# here the block of if condition is determined using curly braces

# but in python block is determined by indentation
# for example
a = 2
if
    a == 2:
    print("hello world")
    b = 2
    if
        b == 2:
        print("python")
        print("Is")
        print("Awesome")
    print("another message")
