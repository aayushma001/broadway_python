# There may be different project in your system with different requirement of packages
# your one project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas other project may require pandas version 2.4
# So to solve this problem we can use the concept of virtual environment

# Virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install packages
# in isolated form for each project.
# Important Commands
1. python -m venv <name_of_the_environment> # it makes a folder environment
    => creates a new virtual environment
2. venv\Scripts\activate(for Windows devices in command prompt)
   Source venv/bin/activate(for mac devices)
    =>activate the virtual environment
3. deactivate
    => it deactivates the virtual environment
4. pip install <package_name>
    =>it installs package to the environment
5. pip freeze
    =>it shows all the installed packages in the environment
