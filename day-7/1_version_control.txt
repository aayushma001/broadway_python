# On development apps or products, we may have different version of that product.if the new version is
# updated then the previous version code should also be maintained.
# so, such maintaining of versions is carried by version control system .there are different version control system.
# there are different version control system like git,mercurial,perforce etc.


Need of version control system
=> to maintain product version.
=> For  team collaboration in a project.


The codes of project should be stored somewhere in the cloud,Google drive  or other cloud storage
services can be used for storing code, but they doesnot provide gitsupport and there will be no
manual work for team collaboration.
So, we use cloud services which understand git instead of Google Drive .
The example of such cloud services which understand git are Gitlab,Bigbucket etc.
